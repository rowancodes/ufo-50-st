# UFO 50 Save Tool
(Windows only)

My partner and I were playing on the same account on the couch, when they started playing on their own I wanted to get them their Divers save, ended up making this.

## Features
- Export specific games to a `.ufodisk` file
- Import `.ufodisk` to your save by dropping them on the .exe
- Copy specific game saves from any slot to another
- Backups your saves before any copy/export/import

## Installation
Go to Releases and download + run the exe. It should automatically detect your save files.
