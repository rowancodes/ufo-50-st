# UFO 50 Save Tool
A save tool/editor for UFO 50. (Windows only)

My partner and I were playing on the same account on the couch, when they started playing on their own I wanted to get them their Divers save, ended up making this.

## Features
- Export specific games to a `.ufodisk` file, and have other people import it on top of any of their saves.
- Copy specific game saves from any slot to another
- Backups your saves before any copy/export/import

## Installation
Go to Releases and download + run the exe. It should automatically detect your save files.
